# Baseball Team Tracker
[Deplyed App](dingoes-945dae28db2c.herokuapp.com/
)

The Dingoes are a new baseball team hoping to join the ranks of the Los Angeles Baseball Federation. This full-stack CRUD application will log the player's stats and record the team's activity.

## Project Idea and description

This _MongoDB/Express/Node_ application will use OAuth authentication to access a database of games played and a team roster with player statisics. There will be comment functionality for the players to discuss post game notes.
